# Well-Logs_Predictive_Models
# ðŸ“Œ Introduction - Project Objective   
The developed predictive ML models have the flexibility to be applied to various well-log datasets. They are not limited to specific data sources or locations. Therefore, you can utilize these models with any well-log data.

# ðŸ“Œ Well-Log Datasets
In this study, two distinct well-log datasets were utilized to evaluate the functionality and effectiveness of the ML predictive models.
1. SÃ£o Francisco onshore data, which have been published by ANP (AgÃªncia Nacional de PetrÃ³leo). The two wells of interest are 1-BRSA-871-MG and 1-BRSA-948-MG. You can access these well-logs at [https://reate.cprm.gov.br/anp/TERRESTREen].
2. Santos offshore data, which have not been publicly released.

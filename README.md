# Well-Logs_Predictive_Models

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction - Project Objective   
This work represents my Master's Thesis in Petroleum Engineering titled:
> Development of Supervised Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Well-Logs & Application on Wells at SÃ£o Francisco and Santos Basins, Brazil"


The objective of this research is to develop a Python code, from scratch, that implements supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB), to build ML models for accurately predicting various types of well-logs. Two separate case studies are conducted to evaluate the functionality and effectiveness of the code. In both studies, the ML models are trained on a first well (training well) and tested on a second well (test well). The first case study focuses on the SÃ£o Francisco onshore Brazilian basin. It serves as a preliminary exercise for model development and data familiarization. The goal is to predict two conventional well-logs: the calculated effective porosity and the measured compressional wave slowness logs. The second case study centers around the Santos offshore Brazilian basin, particularly the deep-water pre-salt carbonate reservoir area of the Itapu Oil Field. The attention of this research is primarily directed toward this second case study. The target is to predict high technological well-logs, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) total, effective, and free fluid porosity logs.

## ðŸ“Œ Well-Log Datasets Used
1. **SÃ£o Francisco Basin Onshore Data** that are published by ANP (AgÃªncia Nacional de PetrÃ³leo). The two wells of interest are 1-BRSA-871-MG and 1-BRSA-948-MG. You can access these well-logs at [https://reate.cprm.gov.br/anp/TERRESTREen].
2. **Santos Basin Offshore Data** that are physically delivered by ANP, in hard drive form. The two wells of interest are 1-BRSA-1116-RJS and 3-BRSA-1215-RJS.

ðŸš¦These predictive ML models can be applied to various well-log datasetsðŸš¦

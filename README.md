# Well-Logs_Predictive_Models
# 📌 Introduction - Project Objective   
The developed predictive ML models have the flexibility to be applied to various well-log datasets. They are not limited to specific data sources or locations. Therefore, you can utilize these models with any well-log data. 
# 📌 Well-Log Datasets
In this study, two distinct well-log datasets were utilized to evaluate the functionality and effectiveness of the ML predictive models.
1. São Francisco onshore data, which have been published by ANP (Agência Nacional de Petróleo). The two wells of interest are 1-BRSA-871-MG and 1-BRSA-948-MG. You can access these well-logs at [https://reate.cprm.gov.br/anp/TERRESTREen].
2. Santos offshore data, which have not been publicly released.
